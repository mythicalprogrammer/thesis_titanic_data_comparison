### Titanic Dataset from Kaggle

I'm doing doing a [tutorial by Trevor Stephens](http://trevorstephens.com/kaggle-titanic-tutorial/getting-started-with-r/) with my data science group.

I didn't expect I learn much considering that I know Random Forest already and R.

But I was wrong. I learned quite a bit especially feature engineering and his reasoning behind handling missing values for different variables.

Thank you Trevor Stephens for the tutorial I've learned a lot.
